## 💡 Common Patterns

### Parallel Execution
```typescript
// Execute on multiple targets simultaneously
await Promise.all(
  targets.map(target => $.ssh(target)`command`)
);
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Use Result pattern for safe execution
const result = await $`command`.nothrow();
if (!result.ok) {
  console.error(`Failed: ${result.error.message}`);
}
```

### Progress Tracking
```typescript
// Track multi-step operations
for (const [index, step] of steps.entries()) {
  console.log(`Step ${index + 1}/${steps.length}: ${step.name}`);
  await step.execute();
}
```

### Connection Reuse
```typescript
// Reuse SSH connections for multiple commands
const server = $.ssh('production');
await server`command1`;
await server`command2`;
await server`command3`;
```
