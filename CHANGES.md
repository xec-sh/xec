- ⚡ Improved startup performance through better code organization  
- ⚡ Enhanced maintainability with cleaner separation of concerns
- ⚡ Optimized memory usage with more focused modules

#### 3. **SSH Adapter Improvements**
- 🔧 Simplified SSH tunnel creation using native NodeSSH `createTunnel` method
- 🔧 Removed complex manual tunnel implementation (~100 lines of code)
- 🔧 Improved tunnel reliability and performance
- 🔧 Better error handling for SSH connection management

#### 4. **Enhanced Testing Coverage**
- 🧪 Expanded SSH adapter tunnel tests (855 lines, ~300% increase)
- 🧪 Updated execution engine tests to reflect new architecture

  - `utils/docker-fluent-api.ts` → `src/adapters/docker/docker-fluent-api.ts`

- 🗂️ **SSH Adapter**: Moved to `src/adapters/ssh/` with all SSH utilities
  - `ssh-adapter.ts` → `src/adapters/ssh/index.ts`
  - All SSH utilities (`ssh-api.ts`, `ssh-key-validator.ts`, `secure-password.ts`, etc.)
  - Connection pool metrics and SSH management tools

- 🗂️ **Kubernetes Adapter**: Moved to `src/adapters/kubernetes/` 
  - `kubernetes-adapter.ts` → `src/adapters/kubernetes/index.ts`
  - `utils/kubernetes-api.ts` → `src/adapters/kubernetes/kubernetes-api.ts`

- 🗂️ **Local Adapter**: Moved to `src/adapters/local/`
  - `local-adapter.ts` → `src/adapters/local/index.ts`
  - `utils/runtime-detect.ts` → `src/adapters/local/runtime-detect.ts`

- 🗂️ **Specialized Adapters**: Organized in dedicated directories
  - Mock adapter: `src/adapters/mock/index.ts`
  - Remote Docker: `src/adapters/remote-docker/index.ts`

#### **Benefits**
- 🎯 **Better Maintainability**: Each adapter is self-contained with its utilities
