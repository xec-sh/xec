# OpenTUI Rust Implementation

This is a Rust port of the OpenTUI terminal rendering library, providing identical functionality to the Zig implementation.

## Overview

OpenTUI is a high-performance terminal rendering library designed for building terminal user interfaces (TUIs) with advanced features like:

- **Optimized buffer management** for efficient terminal rendering
- **Text styling** with full RGB color support
- **Alpha blending** for transparency effects
- **Hit detection** for mouse interaction
- **Text buffer management** for styled text fragments
- **ANSI escape sequence** generation
- **Thread-safe rendering** with optional threaded mode

## Architecture

The library is organized into several modules:

### Core Modules

- **`ansi`** - ANSI escape sequence generation and color utilities
- **`buffer`** - Optimized buffer for cell-based terminal rendering
- **`text_buffer`** - Specialized buffer for styled text fragments
- **`renderer`** - Main rendering engine with double buffering

### Key Features

1. **Double Buffering**: Prevents flickering by rendering to an off-screen buffer
2. **Lazy Rendering**: Only updates changed cells to minimize terminal I/O
3. **Alpha Blending**: Supports transparent overlays with perceptual color blending
4. **Hit Testing**: Tracks clickable regions for mouse interaction
5. **Debug Overlays**: Built-in performance monitoring

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo build tool

### Build Commands

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build with optimizations
cargo build --release

# Build for specific target
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin --release
```

### Cross-compilation

The library supports cross-compilation for multiple platforms:

- Linux (x86_64, aarch64)
- macOS (x86_64, aarch64)
- Windows (x86_64, aarch64)

## FFI Interface

The library exposes a C-compatible FFI interface that matches the Zig implementation exactly. All functions are exported with `#[no_mangle]` and use C calling conventions.

### Example Usage (from C)

```c
// Create a renderer
void* renderer = createRenderer(80, 24);

// Get the next buffer for drawing
void* buffer = getNextBuffer(renderer);

// Draw some text
bufferDrawText(buffer, "Hello, World!", 13, 10, 5, 
               fg_color, bg_color, 0);

// Render to terminal
render(renderer, false);

// Cleanup
destroyRenderer(renderer);
```

## API Compatibility

This Rust implementation maintains 100% API compatibility with the Zig version. All exported functions have identical signatures and behavior, allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement.

### Key Exported Functions

#### Renderer Management
- `createRenderer` - Create a new renderer instance
- `destroyRenderer` - Clean up renderer resources
- `render` - Render the current buffer to terminal
- `resizeRenderer` - Resize the renderer dimensions

#### Buffer Operations
- `createOptimizedBuffer` - Create a new buffer
- `bufferDrawText` - Draw text with styling
- `bufferFillRect` - Fill a rectangular area
- `bufferDrawBox` - Draw a box with borders
- `bufferClear` - Clear the buffer

#### Text Buffer Operations
- `createTextBuffer` - Create a styled text buffer
- `textBufferWriteChunk` - Write styled text
- `textBufferSetSelection` - Set text selection
- `bufferDrawTextBuffer` - Draw text buffer to main buffer

## Performance

The Rust implementation offers comparable performance to the Zig version:

- **Zero-copy rendering** where possible
- **SIMD optimizations** via compiler auto-vectorization
- **Minimal allocations** with pre-allocated buffers
- **Lock-free rendering** in single-threaded mode

## Safety

While the library uses `unsafe` blocks for FFI and performance-critical operations, all unsafe code is:

- Carefully audited for memory safety
- Documented with safety invariants
- Tested with sanitizers and fuzzing

## License

MIT License - Same as the original Zig implementation
