## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run with coverage
npm run test:integration:coverage

# Run specific test file
npx vitest --config vitest.integration.config.ts terminal.integration

# Watch mode
npm run test:integration:watch
```

### Coverage Thresholds
- Lines: 90%
- Functions: 90%
- Branches: 85%
- Statements: 90%

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Applications
Located in `test/fixtures/`:
- `test-terminal-app.js` - Main terminal functionality
- `test-buffer-app.js` - Buffer and ANSI operations
- Dynamic test scripts - Created during test execution

### Test Utilities
- `@xec-sh/tui-tester` - Terminal testing framework
- `tmux` - Terminal multiplexer for test isolation
- `vitest` - Test runner with coverage support

## Continuous Integration

### Requirements
1. tmux installation
2. Node.js 18+
3. Build step before tests

### CI Configuration
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y tmux
    npm ci

- name: Build library
  run: npm run build

- name: Run integration tests
  run: npm run test:integration:coverage

- name: Upload coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    directory: ./coverage-integration
```

## Uncovered Areas

The following areas have limited or no coverage:
- Browser-specific code paths (not applicable in terminal)
- Platform-specific edge cases (WSL detection on non-WSL systems)
- Hardware-specific features (true color on terminals without support)
- Some error recovery paths (difficult to trigger)

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Testing**: Run integration tests before releases
2. **Coverage Monitoring**: Track coverage trends over time
3. **Performance Testing**: Add benchmarks for critical paths
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test on different OS and terminals
5. **Regression Testing**: Add tests for bug fixes

## Metrics

- **Total Test Files**: 5 integration + 20+ unit tests
- **Total Test Cases**: 300+ integration + 500+ unit
- **Execution Time**: ~30 seconds for full suite
- **Coverage**: >90% for terminal-related code
- **Test Isolation**: Each test runs in isolated tmux session

## Future Improvements

1. Add performance benchmarks
2. Test more terminal emulators
3. Add stress tests for memory leaks
4. Test cross-runtime compatibility
5. Add visual regression tests for rendering
