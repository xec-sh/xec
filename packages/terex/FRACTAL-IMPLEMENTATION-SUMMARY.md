# Fractal Architecture Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The fractal architecture for zIndex, draggable, and resizable mechanisms has been successfully implemented in the Terex framework.

## üèó What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced BaseComponent (src/core/component.ts)
- **zIndex Property**: Every component now has a zIndex (default: 0)
- **Layer Type**: Components can specify their layer type (base, modal, overlay, etc.)
- **Draggable Support**: Built-in drag operations with configurable handles
- **Resizable Support**: Built-in resize operations with configurable handles
- **Size Constraints**: Min/max width and height enforcement
- **Movement Boundaries**: Viewport and custom boundary support
- **Parent Awareness**: Components can only be dragged/resized when they have no parent

### 2. Enhanced RenderEngine (src/core/render-engine.ts)
- **Z-Index Layering**: Components are rendered in z-order (lowest to highest)
- **Composite Rendering**: Proper layering with overlapping components
- **Mouse Event Handling**: Integrated drag and resize operations at engine level
- **Hit Testing**: Z-order aware hit testing for mouse events
- **Drag/Resize State Management**: Engine manages active drag/resize operations

### 3. LayerManager Integration (src/core/layer-manager.ts)
- **Layer System**: Manages component layers and z-index ordering
- **Layer Types**: Different z-index ranges for different component types
- **Focus Management**: Handles focus traversal through layers
- **Hit Testing**: Finds components at specific positions respecting z-order

### 4. Refactored Components
- **DraggablePanel Refactored**: New implementation uses base capabilities
- **Factory Functions**: Helper functions for common patterns (windows, modals, tooltips)

## üìã Key Design Decisions

### Fractal Principle
Every component has the same capabilities. There are no "special" draggable or resizable components. This creates a consistent mental model where:
- Any component can have a z-index
- Any component can be draggable (if it has no parent)
- Any component can be resizable (if it has no parent)

### Parent-Child Relationship
Components can only be dragged/resized when they have no parent. This is critical because:
- Layout managers control child positioning
- Prevents conflicts between layout algorithms and manual positioning
- Maintains clear separation of concerns

### Engine-Level Management
The RenderEngine manages drag/resize operations because:
- It has access to all components and their z-order
- Can handle mouse events before they reach components
- Ensures consistent behavior across all components
- Optimizes rendering during drag/resize operations

## üîß API Examples

### Creating a Draggable Window
```typescript
const window = new Box({ title: 'My Window' });
window.setDraggable(true, 'title');      // Drag by title bar
window.setResizable(true, ['bottom-right']); // Resize from corner
window.setZIndex(10);                     // Above base layer
window.setSizeConstraints({
  minWidth: 20,
  maxWidth: 60,
  minHeight: 10,
  maxHeight: 30
});
```

### Creating a Modal Dialog
```typescript
const modal = new Box({ title: 'Confirm' });
modal.setZIndex(1000);        // High z-index for modal
modal.setLayerType('modal');  // Semantic layer type
modal.setDraggable(false);    // Modals typically don't move
modal.setResizable(false);    // Fixed size
```

### Creating a Tooltip
```typescript
const tooltip = new Text({ content: 'Help text' });
tooltip.setZIndex(2000);          // Highest z-index
tooltip.setLayerType('tooltip');  // Semantic type
tooltip.setPosition(mouseX, mouseY);
```

## üß™ Testing

Comprehensive tests have been created in `test/fractal-architecture.test.ts` covering:
- zIndex management and events
- Drag operations with boundaries
- Resize operations with constraints
- Parent-child relationships
- Render engine integration
- Real-world scenarios (modals, windows, tooltips)

## üöÄ Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplicity**: No special components needed for drag/resize
2. **Consistency**: All components follow the same patterns
3. **Performance**: Engine-level optimization for drag/resize
4. **Flexibility**: Any component can be enhanced with these capabilities
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## üìù Migration Guide

To migrate existing components:

### Old Way (Special Component)
```typescript
import { DraggablePanel } from './draggable-panel';
const panel = new DraggablePanel({ 
  draggable: true,
  resizable: true 
});
```

### New Way (Any Component)
```typescript
import { Box } from './box';
const panel = new Box({ title: 'Panel' });
panel.setDraggable(true);
panel.setResizable(true);
panel.setZIndex(10);
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Full Mouse Support**: Implement complete mouse event parsing in InputManager
2. **Visual Feedback**: Add visual indicators for resize handles
3. **Animations**: Smooth transitions during drag/resize
4. **Persistence**: Save/restore component positions and sizes
5. **Accessibility**: Keyboard alternatives for drag/resize

## ‚ú® Conclusion

The fractal architecture has been successfully implemented, providing a clean, consistent, and powerful way to handle component layering, dragging, and resizing in the Terex framework. Every component is now capable of these features when appropriate, eliminating the need for special-purpose components and creating a more maintainable and understandable codebase.
