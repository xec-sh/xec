# Monorepo Configuration Support - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The `xec config list` command and other configuration-related operations were not working correctly in monorepo environments. The `ConfigurationManager` was only looking for `.xec` configuration in the current working directory, not searching up the directory hierarchy to find configuration at the monorepo root.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Project Root Discovery
Implemented a new method `findProjectRoot()` that intelligently searches up the directory tree to find the project/monorepo root by looking for:
- `.xec` directory (highest priority - if found, use that directory)
- `.git` directory (repository root indicator)
- `package.json` with `workspaces` field (npm/yarn monorepo indicator)

### 2. Updated Configuration Loading
Modified `loadProjectConfig()` to:
- First attempt to find the project root using the new discovery mechanism
- Search for configuration files in the discovered root directory
- Fall back to current directory if no root is found
- Support both monorepo root and local configurations

### 3. Enhanced Profile Loading
Updated `resolveProfileWithInheritance()` to:
- Look for profile files in the monorepo root `.xec/profiles` directory
- Fall back to current directory profiles if not found in root
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing setups

### 4. Improved Save Functionality
Modified `save()` method to:
- Save configuration to the monorepo root by default
- Create `.xec` directory structure at the root if it doesn't exist
- Allow explicit path override if needed

### 5. Added Debugging Support
Added `getProjectRoot()` method to:
- Allow users to verify where configuration is being loaded from
- Help debug configuration resolution issues in complex monorepo setups

## Key Features

### Priority Order
When searching for configuration, the system now follows this priority:
1. `.xec` directory (if found, stop searching and use this location)
2. Repository root with `.git` directory
3. Monorepo root with `package.json` containing workspaces
4. Current working directory (fallback)

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-project setups continue to work without changes
- Local `.xec` directories are still supported
- Legacy configuration file locations (`xec.yaml`, `xec.yml`) are still checked

### Debug Support
Set `XEC_DEBUG=true` environment variable to see where configuration is loaded from:
```bash
XEC_DEBUG=true xec config list
```

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite added covering:
- Finding `.xec` config in monorepo root from subdirectories
- Prioritizing `.xec` directory over `.git` directory
- Detecting monorepos via `package.json` with workspaces
- Falling back to current directory when no root is found
- Loading profiles from monorepo root
- Saving configuration to monorepo root
- `getProjectRoot()` method for debugging

## Usage Examples

### In a Monorepo Structure
```
my-monorepo/
├── .git/
├── .xec/
│   ├── config.yaml       # Shared configuration
│   └── profiles/
│       └── production.yaml
├── package.json          # with "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   └── api/
└── packages/
    ├── core/
    └── utils/
```

Running `xec config list` from any subdirectory (e.g., `apps/web`, `packages/core/src`) will now correctly find and use the configuration in `my-monorepo/.xec/config.yaml`.

### Mixed Setup
```
repo/
├── .git/
├── project-a/
│   └── .xec/           # Project A has its own config
│       └── config.yaml
└── project-b/          # Project B uses repo root config
```

- Commands run from `project-a` or its subdirectories will use `project-a/.xec/config.yaml`
- Commands run from `project-b` will search up and potentially use a config at the repo root

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: Single source of truth for monorepo configuration
2. **Flexibility**: Still allows project-specific configs when needed
3. **Developer Experience**: Works seamlessly regardless of current directory
4. **Debugging**: Clear visibility into configuration resolution
5. **Compatibility**: No breaking changes for existing setups
